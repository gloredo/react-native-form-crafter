# React Native Form Crafter
[React Hook Form](https://react-hook-form.com/) is a great library for building forms with [React](https://reactjs.org/) and [React Native](https://reactnative.dev/), but it is a little verbose for complex forms, especially with [React Native](https://reactnative.dev/). **RN Form Crafter** solves this problem providing a flat and customizable API, along with several tools to increase productivity when building forms with [React Native](https://reactnative.dev/).

## Features
- :star: **Agnostic user interface:** By default it uses [React Native Core Components](https://reactnative.dev/docs/intro-react-native-components), but you can use any UI library.
- :star: **Complex form validation:** Thanks to [React Hook Form](https://react-hook-form.com/) it is possible to use [basic validation](https://react-hook-form.com/get-started#Applyvalidation) or [complex schema-based validation](https://react-hook-form.com/get-started#SchemaValidation).
- :star: **Many input types**: Autocomplete, Checkbox, Date, Masked text, Radio button, Select, Text, and Time. 
- :star: **Nested inputs**: Wrap your inputs with other components and they will continue to work as expected.
- :star: **Specific text inputs**: Easily mask and validate common text fields such as phone number, email, password, zip code, etc.
- :star: **Wizard form**: Create complex forms with steps and specific rules in an intuitive way.
